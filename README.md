# Football Information

You have been employed by the Next Level Technologies Ltd. to finish the database layer, which supports basic functionality like importing data and exporting some results.

## Functionality Overview
The firm has hired you as their application developer, to implement the database layer. The application should be able to easily import hard-formatted data and support functionality for also exporting the imported data. The application is called – Football info.

## Model Definition
There are 3 main models that the Football info database application should contain in its functionality.
Design them in the most appropriate way, considering the following data constraints:
### Picture
* id – integer number, primary identification field.
* url – a string (required).

### Team
* id – integer number, primary identification field. 
* name – a string (required) between 3 and 20 characters.
* picture – a Picture entity (required).

### Player
* id – integer number, primary identification field.
* first_name – a string (required).
* last_name – a string (required) between 3 and 15 characters.
* number – a Integer (required) between 1 and 99.
* salary – a Bigdecimal (required) min 0.
* position – a ENUM (required).
* picture – a Picture entity (required).
* team – a Team entity (required).

##### NOTE: Name the entities and their class members, exactly in the format stated above. Do not name them in snake case with the dashes, of course. But if a field is specified as first_name, you are to name it firstName.

#### Relationships
The Football info decided to give you a little hint about the more complex relationships in the database, so that you can implement it correctly.

One Team may have only one Picture, and one Picture may have many Teams.

One Team may have many Players, and one Player may be appointed to only one Team.

One Player may have only one Picture, and one Picture may have many Players.


## Data Import
Use the provided files to populate the database with data. Import all the information from those files into the database.
You are not allowed to modify the provided files.
ANY INCORRECT data should be ignored and a message “Invalid {picture/team/player}” should be printed.
##### NOTE: An incorrect data input is an input which is missing required fields. 
When the import is finished
 “Successfully imported {picture/team/player}- {url/name/firstName lastName}”




### XML Import
The Football info have prepared some XML data for you to import.

## Data Export
Get ready to export the data you’ve imported in the previous task. Here you will have some pretty complex database querying. Export the data in the formats specified below.
#### Export all players North Hub
Export all players which are playing in North Hub:
* Extract from the database, the name of the team and information about the player ordered by id.
"Team: {Name}

Player name: {playerOne firstName} {playerOne lastName} - {playerOne position}

Number: {playerOne number}

Player name: {playerTwo firstName} {playerTwo lastName} - {playerTwo position}

Number: {playerTwo number} 

. . . "

#### Export players with salary bigger than 100000
Export all the players with salary bigger than 100000.
* Export the player’s full name, number, salary and team name order by salary descending.

"Player name: {firstName} {lastName} 

Number: {player number}

Salary: {player salary}

Team: {team name}

. . ."
